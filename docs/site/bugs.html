		<h1>IPSim Bugs</h1>
		
		<h3>Grave Bugs</h3>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-04-14: Some of the menu items don't generate
			log entries, which makes it difficult to mark the
			tests.  These menu items are Add Default Route,
			Add Explicit Route, View/Edit Routing Table,
			View IP Addresses, Enable/Disable IP Forwarding,
			possibly among others.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-03-21: Rik Whittaker discovered that a
			network of three
			computers on one hub tends to show 'network
			unreachable'.  The problem was that an incoming
			Ethernet packet's MAC address wasn't being examined,
			so all the computers were replying to one ping,
			causing strange race conditions.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-06-03: Adding more than one card to a
			computer seemed to add them all in the same place.
			A simple problem caused by List.indexOf not being
			generic.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Normal Bugs</h3>

		<p>
			FIXED: Viewing the routing table of an uninstalled
			network	card throws an exception.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-04-15: File->Save Problem still existed,
			even though there was no way to use the problem.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-15: IPSim will probably crash when the
			server returns DENY instead of the NETSIZE.  This is
			best fixed by making WebInterface an interface, so that
			I can run unit tests that use it, using a local
			version, rather than manually altering the server code
			every time I want to test IPSim.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-04-28: IPSim is uploading the problem too
			late; should be after it has been generated.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-13: View Routing Table didn't display
			a subnet mask for local routes.
			RoutingTableDialog.routingTableCreated added the IP
			address then Gateway: *, so I've changed it to add
			IP address then netmask, then Gateway: *
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2006-06-04: Could not select a cable
			when it is connected so that it could be deleted.
			Accidentally, this was fixed, perhaps not ideally
			though.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-04-22: Some dialogs did not have a title.
			They all do now.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-16: The scrapbook tested all the
			numbers, including red ones.  Now it is more sensible.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-04-27: The scrapbook listed the
			unset networks and IP addresses (blank) when you
			clicked	on Check Numbers.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-17: The user can no longer clear the
			event log in an assessment.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-04-27: The user can no longer enter an
			invalid network number in the edit problem dialog.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-06-03: Cancel doesn't appear unless the
			YesNoCancelDialog is resized.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-06-03: The event log's Ok button is not
			tall enough.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-06-04: The default route dialog's ok button
			is not wide enough.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Minor Bugs</h3>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-22: Think about undo facilities.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-18: Zoom to fit was a bit too far out.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-18: The scrapbook displays 'all numbers
			are correct' even when some numbers are missing.  This
			is not a bug.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-27: The connectivity test dialog displays
			each pair twice (each way around).
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-18: The edit problem dialog was
			non-central.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-05-20: The icons have white borders on
			Windows, in Java 1.5.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-06-03: The computer icon's 'territory'
			extends too far to the right.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-06-03: The scrapbook's Check Numbers button
			is in a strange white panel.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-06-03: Tab doesn't work in YesNoCancelDialog.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-06-03: The Check Solution button does
			nothing when the user hasn't got a Problem.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Feature Requests</h3>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-04-28: IPSim should upload any exceptions
			to the IPSim server, complete with the current user
			data, and ask the user for their email address.
			This should use WebInterface.putException
			("text","config").
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-18: Ask for the email address instead
			of roll number.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-22: IPSim should have a marking mode,
			so that computers with the same IP address are flagged
			to the assessor.  Non-trivial.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-22: Ping/traceroute would benefit from
			a history of recently used IP addresses.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-22: Broadcast ping.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: Cables should have a property of
			"straight through",
			"crossover" or "broken".  Right-clicking the cable will
			tell you which.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-22: Change the name from IPSim to IPSim
			because of BOSON IPSim, a registered trademark.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-22: Automate the version incrementing.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-22: Zoom in and out are too grainy - 
			make it 10% or so.
		</p>

		<p>
			OPEN: 2005-04-28: Consider making 127.0.0.1 work.
		</p>

		<p>
			FIXED: 2005-05-18: There are now confirmation 
			dialogs where you delete components.
		</p>
